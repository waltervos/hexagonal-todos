# Hexagonal todos
Practice Ports and Adapters architecture by creating a todo list app, while using TDD to drive the design.

## User stories
**As a** user  
**I want to** view my todos

**As a** user  
**I want to** add a todo

**As a** user  
**I want to** add a deadline to some of my todos

**As a** user  
**I want to** be alerted about a todo's deadline

**As a** user  
**I want to** mark a todo as done

**As a** user  
**I want to** my todo list to be private to myself

## Running the Flask app: 

```shell
poetry run flask --app=driving_adapters.web.app run
```
